Less attendance is a major issue in schools and colleges as it directly affects studentsâ€™ learning and overall performance. Regular absenteeism often leads to gaps in understanding, poor academic results, and lack of discipline. It also reflects a lack of interest, motivation, or sometimes personal and health-related problems faced by students. Institutions struggle to maintain quality education when attendance is low, and teachers find it difficult to ensure proper participation. Therefore, maintaining good attendance is essential for building knowledge, developing skills, and shaping a responsible academic attitude.
