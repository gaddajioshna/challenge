Less attendance is a major issue in schools and colleges as it directly affects studentsâ€™ learning and overall performance. Regular absenteeism often leads to gaps in understanding, poor academic results, and lack of discipline. It also reflects a lack of interest, motivation, or sometimes personal and health-related problems faced by students. Institutions struggle to maintain quality education when attendance is low, and teachers find it difficult to ensure proper participation. Therefore, maintaining good attendance is essential for building knowledge, developing skills, and shaping a responsible academic attitude.

Low attendance has become a common issue in many schools and colleges,
affecting both academic performance and overall discipline. When students regularly miss classes, 
they fail to keep up with lessons, which leads to poor understanding of subjects and lower grades.
It also disrupts the flow of teaching for educators, as they may have to repeat topics for absentees.
Low attendance can be caused by lack of interest, health problems, personal issues, or even ineffective teaching methods.
Regular attendance is important not only for academic success but also for building responsibility, discipline,and social skills.
Institutions should take necessary measures to encourage students to attend regularly, such as interactive teaching, awareness programs, and strict attendance policie.
